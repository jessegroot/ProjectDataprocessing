# ProjectDataprocessing

Proposal:
•	Problem statement:
o	Today most discussions are about the climate change. So it would be nice to show which country’s do good or bad. This will be done by making a world map and thereon showing the country’s in their reprehensive collar depended on their Greenhouse gas emissions/population. To show which country’s to target hard and which country’s has almost no use in reducing Greenhouse gas emissions. 
•	Solution:
o	By visualizing which country’s actually harm the world the most by Greenhouse gas emissions/head. We can target country’s which cause the most harm and feel good about ourselves because we life in a green country.
o	I’m not visual.
o	Main features:
	1) showing a map of the world and displaying each country in their own correct collar.
	2) possibility to change years.
	3) possibility to select country’s up to 5 and make a graph over the years to show the improvement of the country. (graph type 1)
•	While selecting the country has to get a shadow so you know its selected.
	4) possibility to make a graph of all countries. (graph type 2)
o	Minimum features:
	1, 2
	Thereafter 4 and at last 3.
•	Prerequisites
o	Data:
	https://stats.oecd.org/  Greenhouse gas emissions.  
	https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/  population of the country’s
o	External library’s
	Don’t know yet.
o	Hardest parts
	Getting the format of the world and making each land clickable. 
	Making the program fast
