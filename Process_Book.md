# day 1 (11-1-2019)

This day i made the "Guide of the Program.md" file, in this file i set some global idears of the project
    1) What data i was going to used.
    2) graphs i wanted to make
    3) how the data needs to be formatted for the graphs
    4) how the Graphs should interact with each other.

I also made the file structure: D3, CSS, Data, Images and js_py(scripts).
I wanted to get the html files on opening of the map and the rest of the files in their own catagorisch.

I selected the Color style of the website.

I starded working on bootstrap since i was thought this would make it easy to structure the website into colloms.
However this didnt work at all. I struggled cause i wanted bootstrap in a file on my pc so i could work offline However
this didnt work and i struggled 3 hours with getting my bootstrap code to work but i didnt succeed. so after a while i
just coppied the links and used them to retrieve bootstrap coding and that worked at once....

# day 2 (15-1-2019)

I worked on my bootstrap code since i deleted my 10 other bootstrap codes since i thought it didnt work.
i thought of a layout of the website. that was about it.

# day 3 (16-1-2019)

corrected layout and added some pictures and text in Page_Home.
I made Page_Graph with the correct format and am ready to start working on the data and graphs.
I want to make 2 buttons on the world map at Page_Home to go directly to Problen&Solution.
